 🔍 Why I Created This

As part of my self-learning journey to become an **AML Engineer**, I created this visual to understand the **flow of international AML standards** — how global frameworks like FATF shape the laws and compliance systems in different regions.

It also helps visualize how Pakistan aligns its AML laws with global expectations.
